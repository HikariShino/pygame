# pygame

This is a recreated pong game created from a tutorial.

Has your basics of a pong game with controls using the up and down arrow keys
and a start on left mouse click.

I added custom colors for the paddles and the pong ball with a custom feature where
the ball starts off big and as the speed increases, the ball will become smaller.
